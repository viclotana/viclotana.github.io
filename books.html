                  This website is a quick sneak-peak of a few interesting
                  things I do as a freelance continious learner. <hr>
                  Below is an Overview of a few books I have read this year...</p>

          <div class="job job-1">
              <h3>The Righteous Mind by Jonathan .H</h3>
              <h6>Pyschology</h6>
              <p>This is easily the best book I read this year.
                  It is the first pyschology book I read in a 
                  long while and opened my mind to more psychology.
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="job job-2">
                <h3>Ijeawele by Adichie .C</h3>
                <h6>Feminism</h6>
                <p>This book taught me a lot of parenting.
                    Especially about the concepts of baby-siting,
                    gender roles and narratives we sell to kids.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="job job-3">
                    <h3>The Rational Optimist by Ridley .M</h3>
                    <h6>Pyschology</h6>
                    <p>This is easily my second favorite book
                         of the year. Ridley made so many intresting
                          arguments here. It seems he has a thing or two
                           against organic food movements in the U.S haha </p>
                </div>
            <div class="job job-4">
                    <h3>Finding my virginity by Branson .R</h3>
                    <h6>Business</h6>
                    <p>Richard is the most prolific billionaire english author.
                        He has a very distinct story and view of the world.
                        His life is so fun though with breath-taking business moves.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="job job-5">
                    <h3>The Virgin Way by Branson .R</h3>
                    <h6>Leadership</h6>
                    <p>Here Richard outlines the long lost art of
                        careful listening. I think every wannabe entrepreneur
                        should read this. He also shares business insights about
                        recruitment and keep staff motivated.

                    <h3>China's Distruptors by Edward .T</h3>
                    <h6>Startups</h6>
                    <p>This book paints a good story about China's last 
                        50 years move towards globalization. I did not 
                        actually appreciate the way Tse repeated a lot of 
                        things a couple of times in different ways. It could
                    have been a 200 page book.</p>
